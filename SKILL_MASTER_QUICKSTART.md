# Skill Master Quick Start

Generate AI-powered SKILL files for your codebase in 2 minutes.

## What does it do?

Skill Master analyzes your code and creates SKILL files that teach Claude Code about your:
- 🏗️ Architecture patterns
- 📝 Coding conventions
- 🎨 UI components
- 📦 Code organization

## Quick Start

### 1. Discover patterns

```bash
npm run skill-master:discover
```

Shows what patterns exist in your codebase and which skills are missing.

### 2. Generate skills

```bash
npm run skill-master:generate
```

Creates SKILL files in `.claude/skills/` with real examples from your code.

### 3. Use with Claude

Simply mention pattern names when talking to Claude Code:

- "Create a new custom hook for..."
- "Add a service layer component..."
- "Build a UI component following our patterns..."

Claude will automatically use the appropriate SKILL file.

## Example Output

```

## What Gets Generated?

Each SKILL file includes:

✅ Real code examples from your project  
✅ Best practices from your `.ruler/` files  
✅ File locations and structure  
✅ Trigger keywords for Claude  
✅ Version tracking  

## Customize

Add `.ruler/*.md` files with your coding standards:

```markdown
# My Standards

## Do
- Follow this pattern
- Use this convention

## Don't
- Avoid this anti-pattern
```

Skills will automatically include these rules!

## Learn More

- 📖 **Full docs**: `docs/SKILL_MASTER.md`
- 🎯 **Skills**: `.claude/skills/README.md`
- 🔧 **Implementation**: `src/lib/skill-master.ts`

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript project (auto-detected)

## That's it!

Your codebase now teaches Claude Code how to write code that matches your patterns.
